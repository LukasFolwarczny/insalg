Instant Algorithms
==================

Instant Algorithms, abbreviated as *insalg*, is my algorithmic library.

The very purpose of this library is to provide a set of algorithms written in
a minimalistic but still easy-to-read way. These algorithms can then be very well adapted
to solve a specific algorithmic problem, for example during contests.

Algorithms here are in fact "metaimplemented" rather than implemented. The typical
situation to use the algorithms here looks something like this:
One knows very well the idea of a specific algorithm, but instead of spending time
inventing the technical details of the implementation, he simply modifies the code from
this library to solve his algorithmic task.

Using the algorithms here as a black box is also possible, but their implementation is not
optimized and designed for such a situation.

Algorithms are implemented in C++, although the use of C++ features is very conservative.
It is more of a C code with a few C++ constructs spilled over it.

All the code is simply placed in the *code* directory, a pdf version of all the code may
be generated in the *pdf* directory. Take a look at DOCUMENTATION.md for details about
proper use and info about implemented algorithms.
