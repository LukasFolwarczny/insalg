I believe that interesting part of this project is Booth's algorithm
because the implementation here is in my opinion more lucid than the
one in the original article or the one from Wikipedia.

----------------------
Implemented algorithms
----------------------

In the sake of lucidity, the algorithms are split into categories:
Geometry, Number, Sort, Permutation, String, Heap, Interval

template.cpp

Geometry
  geometry-geometric_median.cpp
    A single function geometric_median runs given number of iterations of Weiszfeld's algorithm for
    the approximation of geometric median.

Number
  number-eratosthenes.cpp
    Eratosthenes siege running in O(n log log n) time.

  number-euclid.cpp
    Basic and extended Euclid algorithm.

Sort
  sort-quicksort.cpp
    Ordinary quick sort implementation.

  sort-kth_smallest.cpp
    Computes the k-th element of the array in linear time using Median
    of Medians algorithm.

Permutation
  permutation-bijection.cpp
    Constructs the bijection between permutations of the length N and
    numbers {0,1,...,N!-1}.

    Before computing it is necessary to run the function init, which
    precomputes the factorial numbers.

    The functions integer_to_permutation and permutation_to_integer
    provide the conversions.

    Time complexity is O(N^2).

Heap
  heap-binary.cpp
    Binary minimum heap. To use the heap, the function must be called.
    make runs in O(N) time, operations delete_min and insert in O(log N).

Interval
  interval-max_tree.cpp

  interval-max_array.cpp

  interval-fenwick.cpp

String
  string-kmp.cpp
    Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm. Failer function is computed with the
    function build. The search of a given word is performed by the
    function search.

  string-minlexrot.cpp
    Booth's algorithm for finding the lexicographically minimal
    rotation of a string. Algorithm is an elegant modification of KMP.

  string-aho_corasick.cpp

Graph
  graph-dfs.cpp

  graph-tarjan_scc.cpp
